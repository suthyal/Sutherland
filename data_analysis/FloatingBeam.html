    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Typically, wave energy converters (WECs) do not perform efficiently in low wave environments, such as prevailing
        calm weather, or within sheltered areas (bays, estuaries, and lakes). The Rapidly Installed Breakwater/Wave
        Amplifier (RIBWA) is designed to focus ocean waves increasing their amplitude such that they enhance the power
        generation capabilities of a broad range of wave energy converters in low sea-state conditions offshore. The
        RIB/WA focuses the predominant oncoming waves within the open 'V' formed by the two floating RIBWA legs, thereby
        enhancing the wave amplitude to excite an individual or an array of wave energy devices installed within the
        'V'. When there is no need for wave amplification the RIBWA can easily be streamed from its apex mooring or
        recovered for storage ashore.
    </p>

    <h1>The RIBWA and Experimental Methods</h1>

    <h2>RIBWA</h2>
    <p>
        The RIB/WA consists of a pair of seawater filled watertight bladder tubes pressurized to a desired level of
        bending stiffness. Each bladder comprises a sealed membrane tube containing the pressurized seawater encased
        within an exoskeleton structural matrix of webbing that resists the primary tensile loads generated by the
        seawater pressurized bladders. Typically, the two bladder units (hereinafter called 'legs') are arranged in a
        'V' formation varying between \(60^{\circ}\) and \(45^{\circ}\). The tubular RIB legs have been designed and
        fabricated up to 30-ft (~9 m) diameter and several hundred feet long. The choice of full-scale RIB leg diameter
        and length is based upon both the water depth in the intended area of operation and the specific application of
        the system.
    </p>


    <h2>Instrumentation</h2>

    <h3>Qualisys Motion Tracking</h3>
    <p>
        The Qualisys motion tracking system was used to measure the free surface displacement as well as the movements
        of the RIBWA at points along its surface. A scaffold was constructed and four Qualisys Arqus cameras were placed
        at each of the scaffold corners and a surveyed platform of Qualisys markers was placed within the scaffold. This
        would allow the movement of Qualisys probes, both during tests and between tests, while still maintaining
        reference coordinates.
    </p>

    <figcaption><em>The layout of Qualisys Markers in the Basin and on the RIBWA</em></figcaption>
</figure>

    <p>
        The Qualisys system was calibrated after every 48 hours, or two test days. The calibration error for a qualisys
        probe is approximately 1mm. Probes measuring the free surface were constructed from foam floats covered in
        Qualisys reflective tape. Each probe was mounted on a steel rod attached to a lead block, and were allowed to
        slide freely on the rod to track the free surface displacement. Probes mounted on foam blocks were attached to
        the RIBWA via epoxy which provides a hold strong enough that the deflection of the probe is due solely to the
        motion of the RIBWA.
    </p>

    <h3>Resistive Wave Gauges</h3>
    <p>
        Resistive wave gauges are comprised of two parallel rods fixed together at a set distance. An alternating
        voltage is passed through the rods as the rods' conductance is measured. This conductance will vary depending on
        the height of the water above the bottom of the wave gauge rods. This measured conductance over the period of
        the test can then be transformed to the height of the free surface over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sixteen wave gauges were placed within the basin in order to measure the free surface. Out of these 16, only two
        were placed within the RIBWA, in order to be used to measure the wave height amplification, which can be seen in
        Figure below. The location of all wave gauges were surveyed and their voltages were calibrated before testing
        was commenced.
    </p>

    <h1>RIBWA Dynamics and Stress Analysis</h1>
    <p>
        The motion of the RIBWA was tracked via 5 Quialsys probes fixed to the body of the RIB. The displacement of
        these five points allowed for a polynomial to be fit to the RIB motion as a representation of its bending.
        Because there are five points polynomials of orders 1,2,3, and 4 serve as possible fits to the RIB motion. A
        second criteria, the stored energy, was used to select the correct fit. Once this fit was determined the maximum
        stresses acting on the beam could be computed.
    </p>

    <h2>Polynomial Fitting and Energy Criteria</h2>
    <p>
        The RIBWA was modeled using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and assumed to undergo pure bending. The bending moment
        along the RIBWA is given by the equation:
    </p>
    \[
    M = -EI\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}
    \]
    <p>
        Where \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity, \( I \) is the second moment of area, and \( w \) is the function
        describing the displacement of the RIBWA. The potential energy stored in the RIBWA is calculated via the
        equation:
    </p>
    \[
    U = \int_0^L \frac{M^2}{2EI}dx
    \]
    <p>
        And so, once the bending moment along the RIBWA is known the stored energy is also known. It is important to
        note that these quantities are obtained at each moment in time and so for every frame of data a bending moment
        and stored energy are calculated. To obtain these quantities at each moment in time a polynomial of degrees 1,
        2, 3, and 4, were fit to the five points along the RIBWA. For each polynomial the coefficient of determination
        was calculated to determine how well it serves as a fit to the data. Likewise, since every beam will attempt to
        minimize its curvature when an external load is applied, the second criteria used to determine the correct
        polynomial fit was the stored energy. An example frame of this process is depicted below.
    </p>

        style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <figcaption><em>Visual representation of energy dynamics using the GIF</em></figcaption>
</figure>
    <p>
        Once the correct fit has been determined the maximum bending stress acting on the RIBWA at each moment in time
        is calculated using the equation:
    </p>
    \[
    \sigma_{\text{max}} = \frac{cM}{I_x}
    \]
    <p>
        where \( c \) is the distance to the extreme fiber of the beam, \( M \) is the maximum bending moment, and \(
        I_x \) is the second moment of area.
    </p>

    <h2>Calculation of Stresses</h2>
    <p>
        The polynomial best matching the deflected shape was determined to be third order. This can be seen by
        inspection of the following Figure. Overall, the third and fourth order fits both had an \( R^2 \) value of 1
        (except at certain frames where the third order fit was just less than 1). However, when the two fits predicted
        slightly different polynomials it was seen that the energy of the fourth order fit was much higher. This is best
        represented by the sum total energy shown in the following figure. It can be seen that the fourth order fit
        predicts a much larger stored energy than the third order fit.

        Once the fit was determined the maximum bending stress at each moment in time was calculated using the previous
        equation. The maximum values follow a normal distribution and can be seen in the following figure.
